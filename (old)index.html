			Topics include computer architecture, data representation,
			operating systems, computing systems in society, and software
			development. Students will implement the major stages of
			software development using a high level language. Topics will
			include loops, selections, and arrays. This advanced course covers

				<h2 style="text-align:center">Teacher Feedback:</h3>
				<h3>Work Time:</h3>
				<p> Students should expect to spend 30 minutes each week for this class.</p>
				<h3>Prerequisites:</h3>
				<p>Required: Algebra 1; Currently enrolled in Geometry or higher <br />
				Recommended:None</p>
				<h3>Useful Skills and Advice</h3>
				<p>As an advanced course a student should never fall behind.  Every topic for the entire year is used for the rest of the year - getting behind in any topic means the student cannot succeed for the rest of the year.  Quizzes make up the bulk of the grade, however the majority of time in class will be based on smaller tasks or projects, all which are used to have students repeatedly make mistakes and learn until things make sense.  If a student decides to rely too heavily on other individuals to get through the smaller tasks or projects, they will not be able to succeed on the quizzes.  This is one of the most entertaining courses that exists, but you cannot fall into the trap that just because it is entertaining that it is easy.</p>
				<h3>What will I Learn?</h3>
				<p>This is an introductory course on how to write code to program software. We work in Java as the primary language to learn most of the basics of how programs are written.  The course should be called PreAP Computer Science, as it leads directly into the AP year, covering approximately 75% of the material on the AP exam, but not quite at the depth of the AP level. Students will learn how to: work with graphics, make objects move around, be controlled by keyboard and mouse, interact with other objects, build subroutines, control when and where code gets triggered, learn the basics of looping, nested looping, arrays, strings, number systems, how colors work in software, and various other topics.</p>
				<h3>How will this course benefit me?</h3>
				<p>Aside from becoming a software programmer as a potential career path, even if a student decides to not go further into computer science they will have gained vital knowledge of how to better use a computer and problem solving skills that can be applied to any field.</p>

includes the following: matter and energy, atomic structure,
bonding, periodic table, mathematics of chemistry, kinetics
and equilibrium, acids and bases, redox and electrochemistry,
organic chemistry, applications of chemical properties, nuclear
chemistry, and laboratory activities. All content objectives are
extended and enriched. Students will complete laboratory

				<h3>Prerequisites:</h3>
				<p>Required: Algebra 1 (with at least B or B+)<br />
				Recommended Corequisite:  at least Algebra 2 (you WILL struggle if you are only in geometry at the same time as Pre-AP Chemistry)</p>
				<h3>Useful Skills and Advice</h3>
				<p>Pre-AP Chemistry requires a much stronger math foundation than general Chemistry 1. PAP students also need strong logic/critical thinking skills to enable them to think on their own and understand higher level concepts.
Pre-AP Chemistry is an extremely difficult course. For many students, it will be one of the most challenging classes they take in high school. We apply math in deeper ways than you've ever been required to do in other classes, while also learning higher-level science concepts. It is not abnormal to struggle in this class, even if you're never struggled in other classes before. As long as you are willing to work hard, ask questions when you're confused, and stay after for extra help when you need it, you should be fine. (And remember, it's okay to get less than an A in this class. Colleges recognize the difficulty level of Pre-AP Chemistry and think highly of students for persevering thought it.) Don't be scared of taking this class, but also don't go into it blind to the effort that you will need to put in, even if school has traditionally been easy for you up to this point.</p>
				<h3>What will I Learn?</h3>
				<p>Scientific measurement, Thermochemistry, Atomic structure, The periodic table, Bonding, Reactions, Stoichiometry, Solutions, Gases, Nuclear and Organic chemistry</p>
				<h3>How will this course benefit me?</h3>
				<p>Chemistry teaches problem solving and critical thinking skills, which are important in every career. Specific career paths opened by chemistry are medicine, pharmacology, research, engineering, forensic science, food sciences (yes, cooking is chemistry!), environmental science, patent law, agriculture, nanotechnology, the development of plastics, electronics, beauty products, and more. 
It also helps students develop scientific literacy, so they are better able to identify science myths perpetuated by social media.

Pre-AP Chemistry also leads very well into taking AP Chemistry the subsequent year.</p>

				<h3>Useful Skills and Advice</h3>
				<p>Students need to be able to apply knowledge learned in first year chemistry and AP chemistry to different situations.  It is rather abstract with more than one way to solve many problems.  An solid foundation in a first year course is necessary. Students should expect to attend study sessions after school.  All home work should be attempted with questions ready in class for any they did not complete.  All labs require a formal write up. If students do not turn in labs they will not be successful.
It is recommended that students have the following skills prior to taking this class: Students should be able to write chemical formulas, balance chemical equations. and do basic stoichiometric calculations.</p>
				<h3>What will I Learn?</h3>
				<p>First year chemistry is reviewed very quickly, going in more depth on some topics.  Additional topics include chemical kinetics, equilibrium, and electrochemistry.</p>
				<h3>How will this course benefit me?</h3>
				<p>Most students who take the class find first year chemistry in college very easy.  This is important because many colleges use freshmen chemistry as a "weeding out" course for students who intend to major in engineering or medical fields.</p>

					<h3>How can Others Survive This Class?</h3>
					<p>Do the homework. It is vital that you practice outside the class. As well as paying attention in class and taking notes. Ask a lot of questions. The reason I put 1-2 hours is because lab reports take a long time. For the most part, the people that take this class are spending hours working and studying. What I also recommend is that you have multiple sources for help on concepts you don't understand. It's important ask any friends you have in the class for help if you are struggling.</p>

					<p>Critical thinking skills and working fast.</p>
					<h3>How has this class Challenged Me?</h3>
					<p>The class is simply challenging. It builds off of things you already knew and then come the new things that you haven't learned yet. The class is especially challenging because of the pace. For the most part, it has been notes and then a quiz the next class. Also there are no filler grades like class work or homework, it's only quizzes, tests, and labs.</p>

					<h3>Work Time</h3>

					<h3>I have Learned...</h3>
					<p>Better study skills, and I am a lot better at solving word problems </p>
					<h3>How has this class Challenged Me?</h3>

					<h3>This class was different from my expectations because...</h3>
					<p>I expected there to be more calculus involved but its mostly algebra at this point.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="Student2" style="text-align:center">
					<h3>Work Time</h3>
					<p>1-2 hours</p>
					<h3>How can Others Survive This Class?</h3>
					<p>The homework isn't graded but you should do it anyway; there are always similar questions on the test. I would also advise you to read the textbook before you start a new unit in class. It's extremely helpful to have a basic overview before diving right in. Make a study group. It really helps to have another student explain concepts to you as well as explain them to other students. I think the best advice I can give is to actually study and try to understand, you might not get it right away but everything builds throughout the year. </p>
					<h3>I have Learned...</h3>
					<p>The course has actually helped me with my Calculus AB class, especially with the motion unit. The math is very similar in both classes and it might even teach you shortcuts. The units build on each other so you should make sure you continue to learn and study instead of just forgetting about it after the test. </p>
					<h3>How has this class Challenged Me?</h3>
					<p>I've always been fairly decent at math but physics did not click at all. I've really had to push myself to understand and achieve the grades I want. I find doing practice problems really helps instead of just learning the concepts. Be prepared for a challenge, but if you apply yourself, you'll do just fine. </p>
					<h3>This class was different from my expectations because...</h3>
					<p>This class was a little different from my expectations. We usually start class with a group multiple choice warm up that just reviews topics and basic problems from the previous class. We then review the homework and either take notes or do free response problems/derivations as a class. Sometimes we do worksheets, labs, or practice AP questions as well individually or in groups. </p>
				</div>
				<div id="Student3" style="text-align:center">
					<h3>Work Time</h3>
					<p>1-2 hours</p>
					<h3>How can Others Survive This Class?</h3>
					<p>This class moves a moderately quick pace, so make sure you do the required readings and homework when they are assigned, even though they are not collected. Also, do as much extra practice as you can, because the quizzes and tests are often a bit more challenging than the worksheets assigned in class. Overall, just keep up with the class and do not get behind. </p>
					<h3>I have Learned...</h3>
					<p>The AP Physics courses have helped me build my problem solving skills and has taught me how to really dissect a problem. This course especially gives you a unique opportunity to understand the world around you, and is a great stepping stone to a future in engineering. </p>
					<h3>How has this class Challenged Me?</h3>
					<p>The class has not challenged me much on the work load, but has challenged me so on the assessments. Often, AP questions are used which are notoriously tricky. Furthermore, a lot of the concepts are easily integrated together, so retaining old information is sometimes difficult. Though, the tests are in no way impossible; I have earned an A on most of them, but this comes from precise studying and note-taking. </p>
					<h3>This class was different from my expectations because...</h3>
					<p>Not very much. Since most people who take this class (including myself) have also taken AP Physics I, the curriculum is very familiar. Although we go a little more in depth, and apply calculus to some problems, the same equations and concepts are taught. </p>

a foundation in biological concepts as well as the opportunity
to apply principles of experimental design in laboratory settings
and on a required student project. Pre-AP Biology includes the
same major areas of study as Biology I but with extensions to
each curriculum objective and associated specialty program. This
course is open to interested students and may be required of
students in specialty programs throughout the county.
Note: This course may utilize animal dissection techniques
as an instructional strategy. Students who conscientiously
object to these exercises will participate in Division-approved
activities that provide comparable learning experiences.
Students are required to take the Biology Standards of Learning
assessment at the end of this course.</p>

				<h3>Work Time:</h3>
				<p>Students should expect to spend 1-2 hours each week for this class.</p>
				<h3>Prerequisites:</h3>
				<p>Required: Completion of both 7th and 8th Grade Science with a B or better<br />
				Recommended: N/A</p>
				<h3>Useful Skills and Advice</h3>
				<p>It is useful for students to have the following skills prior to entering the class: -Basic math skills including multiplication, division, fractions, calculation of percentages, etc.
-Reading comprehension in which a student is able to read a passage and extract the essential information
-Basic graphing skills such as appropriately determining when data should be displayed in a bar graph v a line graph, labeling of axises.
Pre-AP Biology requires the following beyond that of regular Biology 1: additional reading/writing and math application throughout the school year, more in-depth hands-on activities and labs with extended analysis/post-labs, additional out of class assignments such as reading or projects, as well as students will receive extended content instruction for each unit that goes beyond SOL standards and assessments will require more higher order thinking to this affect.</p>
				<h3>What will I Learn?</h3>
				<p>Unit 1: Science Process Skills (graphing, basic statistics/math, using common scientific equipment, making measurements, etc.)
Unit 2: Ecology (ecological organization, interactions between organisms, population ecology, components of ecosystems, food chains/webs)
Unit 3: Biochemistry (basic chemistry including bonding and chemical reactions, biological molecules, enzymes)
Unit 4: Cellular Structure and Function (comparison of types of cells, exploration of eukaryotic cell components and functionality, components of the cell membrane and cellular transport)
Unit 5: Cellular Processes (photosynthesis, cellular respiration, cell cycle, cellular reproduction: mitosis and meiosis)
Unit 6: Protein Synthesis (history and structure of DNA and RNA, transcription/translation, universal genetic code)
Unit 7: Genetics (modes of inheritance, Mendelian genetics and Punnett squares, non-Mendelian genetics and Punnett squares, probability)
Unit 8: Evolution (natural selection, evidence for evolution)
Unit 9: Taxonomy (kingdoms of life, comparison of eukaryotic organisms)
Unit 10: SOL Review
Unit 11: Post-SOL Materials (content that appears in standards but is not tested on by SOL test: survey of human body systems and processes)</p>
				<h3>How will this course benefit me?</h3>
				<p>Pre-AP Biology is students' first opportunity to gain exposure to advanced science curriculum at the high school level. Students who are successful in Pre-AP biology will likely be better prepared for other Pre-AP and AP sciences. The content of the course is a rudimentary level survey of the type of material that a pre-medical/dental/pharm/veterinary student would take across their major courses for an undergraduate degree, which may help students develop interests in these fields.
Some skills gained in this course are: -Science process skills that build upon previous learning including statistical analysis, creating and reading graphs, and collecting accurate measurements
-Basic understanding of components of life, types of living things, and their interactions including disease processes
-Experience conducting hands on laboratory exercises that will provide foundational skills for future science classes in high school and beyond</p>

				<h3>Prerequisites:</h3>
				<p>Required: Algebra 1 (with at least B or B+)<br />
				Recommended Corequisite:  at least Algebra 2 (you WILL struggle if you are only in geometry at the same time as Pre-AP Chemistry)</p>
				<h3>Useful Skills and Advice</h3>
				<p>Pre-AP Chemistry requires a much stronger math foundation than general Chemistry 1. PAP students also need strong logic/critical thinking skills to enable them to think on their own and understand higher level concepts.
Pre-AP Chemistry is an extremely difficult course. For many students, it will be one of the most challenging classes they take in high school. We apply math in deeper ways than you've ever been required to do in other classes, while also learning higher-level science concepts. It is not abnormal to struggle in this class, even if you're never struggled in other classes before. As long as you are willing to work hard, ask questions when you're confused, and stay after for extra help when you need it, you should be fine. (And remember, it's okay to get less than an A in this class. Colleges recognize the difficulty level of Pre-AP Chemistry and think highly of students for persevering thought it.) Don't be scared of taking this class, but also don't go into it blind to the effort that you will need to put in, even if school has traditionally been easy for you up to this point.</p>
				<h3>What will I Learn?</h3>
				<p>Scientific measurement, Thermochemistry, Atomic structure, The periodic table, Bonding, Reactions, Stoichiometry, Solutions, Gases, Nuclear and Organic chemistry</p>
				<h3>How will this course benefit me?</h3>
				<p>Chemistry teaches problem solving and critical thinking skills, which are important in every career. Specific career paths opened by chemistry are medicine, pharmacology, research, engineering, forensic science, food sciences (yes, cooking is chemistry!), environmental science, patent law, agriculture, nanotechnology, the development of plastics, electronics, beauty products, and more. 
It also helps students develop scientific literacy, so they are better able to identify science myths perpetuated by social media.

Pre-AP Chemistry also leads very well into taking AP Chemistry the subsequent year.</p>

1. Students should stay after school with their teacher for help on a consistent basis. 
a)	Also, there are former students who offer to peer tutor current students one-on-one after school, if any student would like. 

2. Students should participate consistently and ask clarifying questions during class time – that way they can leave the classroom feeling confident with their understanding of the material.

3. Students should attempt every problem from the homework and revisit and reattempt problems that the student missed. 
a)	Students should use their notes to help complete homework. 
b)	Students should ask questions about homework problems they didn't understand how to attempt or didn’t get the correct answer to either during class time or before/after school. 
c)	No homework assignment should take more than 30-40 minutes of uninterrupted time to complete.

4. Students should reference their unit calendar for the suggested practice problems that are in their textbook.
a)	The back of the unit calendar also has online videos and online practice websites that give immediate feedback.

5. Students could make mini study guides before quizzes and tests by pulling questions from the notes/CW and HW assignments/book
a)	Give an allotted amount of time to finish review problems in, without the use of notes, to prepare for the assessments. That way the student can see what concepts they need more practice on until they master the skill(s) before they take an assessment. Quizzes are usually about 20-30 minutes and tests are the full block. 

6.  Students can log in and use the Khan Academy account the school system has set up for them. Instructions on how to log in to create and use the account are on my school messenger page.

				<h3>What will I Learn?</h3>
				<p>Functions/Trigonometry is a one-year preparatory course for AP Calculus BC. This course is designed for students who have successfully completed the standards for Algebra II /Trigonometry. Basic course content develops students’ understanding of algebraic, exponential and logarithmic functions, parametric and polar equations, series and sequences, vectors, limits, continuity and derivatives. 
</p>
				<h3>How will this course benefit me?</h3>
				<p>This class is challenging as it is setting up students to take AP Calculus BC. Students who are enrolled in Functions Analyt as a junior can take Calc BC their senior year. Students who are enrolled in Functions Analyt as a sophomore have the option to take Calc BC their junior year. The county may offer the classes after Calc BC (Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra) beginning next year, however, this has not been confirmed.

Students should highly consider taking this class if they are interested in having a STEM related career.</p>

					<p>Try to spread out the time it takes to get your homework done since if not you could end up having at least an hour or more of math work to do in one night. Also if you don't fully understand something you should ask your teacher to clarify it better, and stay after school for extra help.  Ask questions whenever you are confused on a topic because it is essential that you understand each skill before moving onto the next skill and stay after if it is necessary to receive extra help. Also, always make sure you have a friends phone number to ask them last minute questions.</p>

Although all of the elements of the Advanced Placement Calculus AB course are included, this course provides a more rigorous treatment of these introductory calculus topics. The course also includes the development of the additional topics required by the College Entrance Examination Board in its syllabus for Advanced Placement Calculus BC. Among these are parametric, polar, and vector functions; the rigorous definition of limit; advanced integration techniques; Simpson’s Rule; length of curves; improper integrals; Hooke’s Law; and the study of sequences and series. The use of the graphing calculator will be fully integrated into instruction and students will be called upon to confirm and interpret results of problem situations that are solved using available technology. Students are required to take the AP Calculus BC examination which is administered in May. College credit and/or advanced placement in college is available to those students receiving a qualifying score on the Advanced Placement Examination.</p>

					<p>You should only be taking this course if you genuinely love mathematics. If it takes a lot of time for you to understand abstract concepts, this course may eat up a lot of your time. You should also refine your skills from geometry and algebra.</p>
					<h3>I have Learned...</h3>
					<p>This course covers derivatives (Slope of a curve) and their applications, integrals (Area under a curve) and their applications, and sequences and series.  I have gained a really good understanding of calculus which directly correlates with Physics and I intend on applying these skills to projects in the near and far future.</p>

					<p>This class truly tests your understanding of the material not just in the sense that you can memorize things, but that you can combine everything learned in a unit and apply them to one big problem.</p>
					<h3>This class was different from my expectations because...</h3>
					<p>I thought this class was going to be pretty easy, but coming from FAG Math directly to Calc BC, it ended up being a huge challenge especially in comparison to the AB kids.</p>

				<h3>Useful Skills and Advice</h3>
				<p>Work with others to understand material, however, make sure you individually understand the material afterwards.  It does not help you in any way to have assignments finished that you could not re-think through alone.</p>
				<h3>What will I Learn?</h3>
				<p>The AP Course has a very specific curriculum that hits on the topics of the APCSA exam, but we also hit on material not on the exam as well.  The most important topics will be: Strings/Arrays/2D Arrays/ArrayLists, Classes/Abstract Classes/Interfaces, Searching/Sorting/Other Standard Algorithms, recursion.</p>
				<h3>How will this course benefit me?</h3>
				<p>In almost any survey you read you will find computer science as number 1 in the following three categories: highest satisfaction in career, highest average salary, and most needed jobs.  CS is used in every field, not just sitting around typing away.  Examples: build a better way to raise money for causes, program a way to help impaired individuals to see/hear/move using technology, make cars drive themselves, set up environments where people can learn topics and get instant feedback to see if they are correct, design ways to make your home become automated for tasks, design apps for an infinite amount of purposes.</p>
